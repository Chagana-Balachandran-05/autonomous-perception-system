    OWASP Dependency Check Suppressions
    
    This file documents false positives or accepted risks in dependency scanning.
    Each suppression must include justification explaining why it's safe to ignore.
    
    Format:
    - packageUrl: Identifies the specific dependency
    - cve: The specific CVE being suppressed
    - notes: Mandatory justification for suppression
    -->
    
    <!-- Example suppression (remove or replace with actual needs) -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>
            Example: This CVE affects version 2.x of Jackson, but we use version 3.x
            which has the vulnerability patched. False positive from version detection.
        </notes>
        <packageUrl regex="true">^pkg:maven/com\.fasterxml\.jackson\.core/jackson\-databind@.*$</packageUrl>
        <cve>CVE-2020-36518</cve>
    </suppress>
    
    <!-- 
    Additional suppressions can be added here as needed during development.
    Always document WHY each vulnerability is being suppressed.
    Review suppressions regularly - they may become outdated.
